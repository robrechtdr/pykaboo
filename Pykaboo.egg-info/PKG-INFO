        ===========
        
        A small project that makes checking python source code from the python standard library and user installed packages more comfortable.
        
        Running Pykaboo opens a new tab in your browser listing your python standard library modules folder and user installed packages folder. New paths can also be added to this list. 
        
        When clicking on a .py file, python syntax is highlighted and lines are numbered. 
        
        Typical usage::
        
            $ pykaboo
        
        For a list of commands::
        
            $ pykaboo help
        
        Tested on python2.7.3 .
