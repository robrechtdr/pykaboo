=======
Pykaboo
=======

A convenient command line tool to check python source code from the python standard library and user installed packages.

Running Pykaboo opens a new tab in your browser listing your python standard library modules folder and user installed packages folder. New paths can also be added to this list. 

When clicking on a .py file, python syntax is highlighted and lines are numbered. 

Typical usage::

    $ pykaboo

Pykaboo shows only '.py' files and directories by default. But you can also allow files with other extensions to be viewed::

    $ pykaboo allow .css

Or you can add custom directories next to the default links to the standard library modules and user installed packages::

    $ pykaboo add ~/Documents/my_python_projects

For a list of commands::

    $ pykaboo help
