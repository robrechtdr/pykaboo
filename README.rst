Pykaboo
===========

A small project that makes checking python source code from the python standard library and user installed packages more comfortable.

Running Pykaboo opens a new tab in your browser listing your python standard library modules folder and user installed packages folder. New paths can also be added to this list. 

When clicking on a .py file, python syntax is highlighted and lines are numbered. 

Typical usage::

    $ pykaboo

For a list of commands::

    $ pykaboo help

Tested on python2.7.3 .
